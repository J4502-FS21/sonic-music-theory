  <h1>The Sound of Speed</h1>
  <p>The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise might be one of the most polarizing video game franchises in all of history. The quality of the games is not consistent. Every time they hit a peak in greatness, they almost immediately drop into a valley of awfulness. It is sometimes difficult being a fan of this franchise, wanting Sega to do better and being disappointed when they don’t.</p>
  <p>However, if there is one consistency, it’s that almost every game has fantastic music. It’s the one element that everyone can agree on with the Sonic franchise. The sound team always puts their best foot forward in order to produce some amazing soundtracks. Sega has always put an emphasize on making the music for each game memorable and not just background pieces.</p>
  <p>I’m dedicated to showing why the music in this franchise is so good. Come along, enjoy the music that was offered for the 2D and 3D games in this franchise. Hopefully you won’t get a headache for the games that are infamous for their bad music.</p>
