  <h1>The 2D Platformers</h1>
  <p>If I had to place all the music for the 2D Sonic Games in one genre, it would most definitely have to be pop. Specifically electropop. Sonic was specifically made to be a cool character. In order for the character’s personality to come through in a game with no cutscenes, they would have to find other means to do so. One of the ways they accomplished this was through the music. Sonic was also partially based off of Michael Jackson, so it makes sense that they would use pop music to make more cool. There is also the fact that the music helps put you at the same speed as Sonic. Electropop is one of the reasons that 2D Sonic comes off as a cool character.</p>
  <p>There is so much history behind the musically development of these games. The music teams for each game tried to make catchy beats out of the music. I hope going through the timeline will show that effort.</p>
  <p>Also, I recommend clicking on the videos and listening to the music as you read, so that you can hear what I’m saying.</p>
