    <h1>The 3D Action-Adventures</h1>
    <p>Now, labeling a genre for 3D Sonic music is a bit harder, since it because less relevant the further you go on. However, if I had to give a genre, it would a 100% be rock. When the first 3D sonic game came out when rock music was very popular in America. Sonic games have always catered more towards and American audience, so the popularity in rock definitely influenced franchises musical direction. And while the modern Sonic era (which started around 2010 and is still going on) has seen a decrease in rock, it is still there. One of the reason 3D Sonic is so cool is because of the rock music, and you can’t easily get rid of that.</p>
    <p>When doing research, I couldn’t find a lot of history into the musical development of the 3D games. So most of what is written my personally opinion about the music. Keep that in mind when going through the timeline.</p>
    <p>And before any Sonic fans come at me about discluding some games, I can’t include very single one. Yes, Sonic R’s soundtrack is amazing, but I decided to only talk about the mainline 3D Sonic games.</p>
    <p>Also, I recommend listening to the music as you read, so that you can hear what I’m saying.</p>
