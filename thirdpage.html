    <h1>The Games with Bad Music</h1>
    <p>Now, I wasn’t originally going to include this section because I’m suppose to be talking about the good Sonic music. However, I felt that it wouldn’t not be fair. Only portraying the good would make it seem like no Sonic game has ever had bad music. But that simple isn’t the case.</p>
    <p>I haven’t touched on every Sonic game that has come out, because it would take way too long and there are some games that are that notably for good music. However, the two games I’m going to be talking about are the only ones that are know for having bad music. That’s really saying something, since the franchise is now 30 years old.</p>
    <p>But now, let us discuss the bad music.</p>

                  </header><b>Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</b>
                  <p>I’m not gonna lie, I don’t know what happened with the Sonic Chronicles’ soundtrack. I have heard so many stories about what happened; copyright issues, they ran out of time, they deleted all the music files. Just about every reason has been listed. And none of those reasons is an excuse for this awfulness. The quality of the music is so low that it is almost hard to decipher. The notes sound like they were tossed into a blender The melody is none existent. The soundtrack just gives me a headache listening too is.</p>

                  <b>Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric</b>
                  <p>I wouldn’t say that the music is Sonic Boom is bad, in and of itself. The music is very generic, but if it had been used for a stand alone kids game, I don’t think anyone would complain. The problem is that this is for a Sonic game, which has constantly shown that it is able to make stellar music for its games. So, having this generic soundtrack associated with Sonic is very disappointing. It’s not a bad game soundtrack, but it is a bad Sonic game soundtrack.</p>
